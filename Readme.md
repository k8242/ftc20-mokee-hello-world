    1. Code + Commits
    1. main branch and child branches
        1. Clone, push, and pulling
        1. Pull Requests
1.  What’s a good learning example without coming up with arbitrary code that can’t work b/c we don’t want that distraction too?  Because for this, we’re trying to learn about code revision.
    1. Markdown - just text, previewable (e.g. imagine as compiling) in VSCode and viewable in Github.
        1. Good short summary (just read page, not links):  https://typelink.net/wolfewithane/Why+Your+Kids+Should+Be+Writing+in+Markdown

1.  The team exercise (branch) using two poems and short commentary.  Create a usable document format.  E.g., what would help it be useful to a reader who has never met you?

    1. Try to use MD syntax.
    1. Create branches for each team member.
    1. Make changes to play around.
    1. Update when necessary.
